So here it is! Textures from Quake, it's two mission packs (Scourge of Armagon and Dissolution of Eternity),
the WizardWorks expansion Q!Zone (which was actually a cool episode and not a shovelware shitfest like
D!Zone, Duke!Zone and H!Zone) and QTest.

I'd like to thank Gez for implementing Quake BSP support into SLADE. I would have done this with XWE, but
it's batch exporting is flawed when it comes to Quake. So, thanks dude!

Aside from that, there's a few textures that would benefit from mirroring in TEXTURES, like the arches.
I didn't define the buttons, but that's just because I'm lazy. Have fun, kids! --Ceeb

PS: Yes, Q1EX is intentional. It means Quake 1 + Expansions. :P
